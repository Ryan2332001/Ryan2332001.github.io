    <h2 style="color:aliceblue">Week 2</h2>


    <p><b style="color:aliceblue">1) Spend two minutes with the experience and list all of your actions in granular detail.</b></p>

    <ul>
     <li style="color:aliceblue">The website that I chose is the National <a href="https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/" target="_blank"><b>Gallery of Victoria</b></a>, as first, I scroll down to see the overall of the site, then I enter each piece of art that shows on the website, then I try to enter all the tabs that appeared in the Home page and reach all tabs in menu button at last.
     </li>
    </ul>
    

    <p><b style="color:aliceblue">2) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?
    </b></p>

    <ul>
      <li style="color:aliceblue">The homepage's minimalist design caught my attention immediately. The main page displays black typography on a white backdrop, and the arrangement of information and images gives it a contemporary appearance. This website was not having very impressive pieces of elements, but it has a really clean style, and the way they provide information just meets my tastes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <b style="color:aliceblue" >3) What did you spend the most time engaging with?
      </b>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li style="color:aliceblue">The thing that I engaged very much as first is how the elements of the page interact and react with the mouse, then to get how the button transitions between the mouse click and I look through all the inside page to see how the information was presented. 
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b style="color:aliceblue">4) What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?</b>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li style="color:aliceblue">The only two things i can do with this website are clicking and moving the mouse all around. This website is more focused on the formal experience so there is nothing to do much with this kind of website.  
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b style="color:aliceblue">5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?
    </b></p>

    <ul>
      <li style="color:aliceblue">As demonstrated, compare with other websites in the given list, this website has been done with very good design with consistent font choice and coherent information, and an overall high-end feel. With the main goal is to become the present place for the Gallery on the internet I pay meticulous attention on the Design and the simplicity of interaction in it.  
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><b style="color:aliceblue">6) How does the experience communicate its primary goal?
    </b></p>

    <ul>
     <li style="color:aliceblue">With the primary objective of establishing a connection between The Gallery and customers or visitors, I believe this website does an excellent job of presenting and distributing its content. The website's design is user-friendly and demonstrates the formality required of a National Gallery, and the way the image appears when the branch site is opened is slightly impressive.
     </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b style="color:aliceblue">7) What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?
    </b></p>

    <ul><li style="color:aliceblue">It seems minimalis so the interactive elements were small but it has good timing and feels natural. 
    </li></ul>

      <b>8) What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference? 
      </b>
    </p>

    <ul><li>Active Metaphors make the website so much more impressive</li></ul>

    <p><b>9) What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it?
    </b></p>

    <ul><li>When coming into contact with this website I feel the elegance and modernity and minimalism, along with the vibrancy of live images.</li></ul>

    <p><b>10) What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you?
    </b></p>

    <ul><li>the most frustrating and satisfying thing at the same time was the design, the design makes the website look simple but it is not because I think making all the elements have a sense of harmony takes a lot of effort in designing and coding </li></ul>
